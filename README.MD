Project Title: Chat Application

Project Description: This project consists of a simple chat application where a server and client can communicate with each other. The server script allows the user to start a server, specifying an IP address, port number, and username. The client script connects to the server using the IP address and port number provided by the user, and also requires the user to input a username. The server and client can send messages back and forth until either side enters the "end" keyword, at which point both sides will disconnect.

Usage Instructions:

Run the server.py script on the machine where you want to host the server. Enter the IP address (press Enter for localhost), port number (press Enter for default port), and your username.
Run the client.py script on the machine where you want to connect as a client. Enter the IP address, port number, and your username to establish a connection with the server. The port number is 12345
Once connected, you can start exchanging messages with the other connected user.
To end the conversation and disconnect, type "end" and press Enter on either the server or client side.
